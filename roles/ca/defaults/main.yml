organization:

# Certificate for the CA node will be saved as k8s secret. The name
# of the secret is configurable, this is to allow users to use
# their own certificate. If the secret name is left empty, then
# this operator will automatically generate self signed certificates
# based on the given organization name and name of the ca node. The name
# of the secret will be the concatnation of the ca node name
# organization name and ca certs. For example, if the ca node name is ca1
# organization name is example.com, then the ca secret name will be
# ca1-example-com-certs. The generated cert, private key and tls
# cert, key will be saved in the secret in the following format
# 
# data:
#   ca-cert.pem: <base64 encoded>
#   ca-key.pem: <base64 encoded>
#   tls-cert.pem: <base64 encoded>
#   tls-key.pem: <base64 encoded>

# admin id and password secret. When setup CA node, the node must
# be configured with id and password for admin. If not specified
# the operator will generate one using admin as username and a random
# string as password. Then saved the id and password in a k8s basic
# authentication secret named using the combination of the CA name,
# organization name + admin, character dot in either node name or
# organization name will be replaced by character dash. For example,
# if the ca node name is ca1, organization name is example.com, then the
# this secret name will be ca1-example-com-admin. The secret must
# follow this format:
#   username: <admin by default>
#   password: <password>
